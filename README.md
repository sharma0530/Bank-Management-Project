# Bank-Management-Project <br>
I am pleased to present my Bank Management Terminal Application, a console banking application developed in C++. The project demonstrates major Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, file handling, and exception handling to make banking operations seamless.<br>
ðŸ”¹ Key Features <br>
âœ… Open an Account â€“ Open a new bank account with a initial deposit.<br>
âœ… Balance Enquiry â€“ Fetch account balance immediately. <br>
âœ… Deposit & Withdrawal â€“ Carry out safe transactions while ensuring minimum balance. <br>
âœ… Close an Account â€“ Remove a current bank account. <br>
âœ… Show All Accounts â€“ Display information of all current accounts. <br>
âœ… File-Based Storage â€“ Store data of accounts persistently using file handling. <br>

ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack <br>
ðŸ”¹ Language: C++ <br>
ðŸ”¹ Concepts Used: <br>

â€¢ OOP (Classes, Encapsulation, Abstraction) <br>
â€¢ File Handling for persistent storage <br>
â€¢ Exception Handling for secure transactions <br>
â€¢ STL (Maps) for efficient account handling <br>
ðŸ”¹ Challenges & Learnings <br>
Use of file handling to ensure persistent data storage.
Exception handling, e.g., insufficient funds situations.
Utilizing STL maps to effectively store and retrieve account information. <br>
ðŸ”¹ Future Enhancements <br>
â€¢ User Authentication â€“ PIN-based login for enhanced security. <br>
â€¢ Transaction History â€“ Keeping a record of all transactions. <br>
â€¢ Graphical User Interface (GUI) â€“ Improving usability with an interactive interface. <br>

This project has been a great learning experience in C++ programming, data structures, and software development. Contributions and suggestions are always welcome! ðŸš€ <br>
