# Bank-Management-Project 
I am pleased to present my Bank Management Terminal Application, a console banking application developed in C++. The project demonstrates major Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, file handling, and exception handling to make banking operations seamless.
ðŸ”¹ Key Features
âœ… Open an Account â€“ Open a new bank account with a initial deposit.
âœ… Balance Enquiry â€“ Fetch account balance immediately.
âœ… Deposit & Withdrawal â€“ Carry out safe transactions while ensuring minimum balance.
âœ… Close an Account â€“ Remove a current bank account.
âœ… Show All Accounts â€“ Display information of all current accounts.
âœ… File-Based Storage â€“ Store data of accounts persistently using file handling.

ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack
ðŸ”¹ Language: C++
ðŸ”¹ Concepts Used:

â€¢ OOP (Classes, Encapsulation, Abstraction)
â€¢ File Handling for persistent storage
â€¢ Exception Handling for secure transactions
â€¢ STL (Maps) for efficient account handling
ðŸ”¹ Challenges & Learnings
Use of file handling to ensure persistent data storage.
Exception handling, e.g., insufficient funds situations.
Utilizing STL maps to effectively store and retrieve account information.
ðŸ”¹ Future Enhancements
â€¢ User Authentication â€“ PIN-based login for enhanced security.
â€¢ Transaction History â€“ Keeping a record of all transactions.
â€¢ Graphical User Interface (GUI) â€“ Improving usability with an interactive interface.

This project has been a great learning experience in C++ programming, data structures, and software development. Contributions and suggestions are always welcome! ????
